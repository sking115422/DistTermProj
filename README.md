# SBC Semi-Distributed Peer-to-Peer File Transfer

## Notes

* DistShared file needs to be placed in same file as the master folder for this code. I thought we could put it on the C drive of every machine, but the file structure is different for mac and pcs so for now we can just use the folder in this code repo until we can figure out something better


* Must have server running on target machine, then you can start client and follow prompts
